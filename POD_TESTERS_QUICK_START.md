# Pod Testers Quick Start

This guide is for friends testing Gatherer on real phones.  
You do **not** need Expo Go.

## 1) Get your install link

Ask the pod organizer for your platform link:

- iPhone (iOS) install link
- Android install link

## 2) iPhone setup (one-time)

If this is your first iOS install, your device may need to be registered first.

1. Send your device registration details to the organizer when asked.
2. Wait for confirmation that your device is added.
3. Install from the newest iOS build link.

## 3) Install the app

### iPhone

1. Open the install link on your iPhone.
2. Follow prompts to install.
3. If iOS blocks launch, trust the developer profile in Settings (as prompted by iOS).

### Android

1. Open the install link on your Android device.
2. Download/install the APK.
3. If prompted, allow installs from unknown sources for your browser.

## 4) Sign in

1. Open Gatherer.
2. Use your email magic link sign-in.
3. If the link opens in browser and does not return, use the in-app "paste link" fallback on the auth screen.

## 5) Turn on notifications

Allow notifications when prompted so your pod can test real reminders and updates.

## 6) Keep your build up to date

When a new test build is shared, install it from the latest link from the organizer.

## 7) Report issues

Send screenshots, exact error text, phone model, and OS version to the organizer.
